# spotify-playlist-downloader in node js

1. clone repo

2. open the repo locally and open terminal

3. npm install

This uses puppeteer to extract spotify playlist info so it'll download chromium (150-200mb)

4. edit playlist url variable and set your playlist link in "downloader.js" file [line 5]

5. node downloader.js

-> Now a song folder will be created in the current local repo folder.

-> If by chance you stop the program in between so no worries as if song is already downloaded then next time it wont be donwloaded again!

-> Playlist info will be extract and all the matching songs will start donwloading!

-> Also there is 5% chance that song's some remix or different same name song will get downloaded...
